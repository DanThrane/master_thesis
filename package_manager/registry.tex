\section{Registry}

Stuff we need to cover in this section:

\begin{itemize}
\item Core responsibilities, such as: publish and download
\item Secondary responsibilities: Package information and dependencies
\item Tertiary responsibilities: Users and groups
\item Once responsibilities are in place we should talk about how we split up
the work-load.
\end{itemize}
