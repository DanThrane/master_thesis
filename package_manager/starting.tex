\section{Putting it all Together: Starting Packages}

In this section we will explore what happens when the \txtl{jpm start} command
is invoked. It will cover everything from the front-end all the way to the
registry and back. We won't cover implementation details, as many of the
details are either uninteresting or have been covered elsewhere.

The package we'll be working on is the calculator system, in particular the
starting of the \txtl{calculator} service. We cover how this system is made
into package in Section \ref{sec:calculator_packages}.

From the \txtl{calculator}'s root the user runs:

\begin{minted}{text}
dan@host:/calculator # jpm start
\end{minted}

\subsection{The \txtl{jpm} Binary}

This invokes the \txtl{jpm} binary. This causes the front-end service to be
started with a 

\subsection{The JPM Front-End (\txtl{jpm-cli})}

\subsection{The JPM Back-End (\txtl{jpm})}


TODO I'm not sure we need this.
