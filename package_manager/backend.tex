\section{The JPM Back End}

The back end service is responsible for performing most of the heavy lifting,
for the commands that are send to it from the front end. Some of the jobs
are performed directly by this service, while quite a few others are
delegated.

The most important partner the back end service has is the registry service.
The back end will communicate with one or more registry services, which are
covered more in depth in Section TODO.

The JPM back end collaborates with a few external services, these are
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:jpm_arch}.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{registry}: Primary collaborator, responsible for storing
packages. See Section TODO

\item \textbf{execution}: Used for starting package (Section TODO), and
executing life-time hooks (Section TODO)

\item \textbf{lockfiles}: Handles the lockfiles feature (Section TODO)

\item \textbf{semver}: Library package for dealing with semantic versioning
(Section TODO)

\item \textbf{cached downloader}: Acts as a cache for downloaded packages
(Section TODO)

\item \textbf{packages}: Validator for the internal package format (Section
TODO)

\item \textbf{pkg}: Responsible for creating the binary format used for
distribution (Section \ref{sec:pkg})

\end{enumerate}
