\section{Introduction}

A Jolie Package is an extension of a Jolie Module. Recall that a Jolie Module
was defined as a collection of resources, a name, and optionally an entry-point
for the module. A package extends this concept by adding information required
for package management. % TODO Last sentence sucks

A Jolie Package is described by a package manifest. The package manifest is a
JSON file, which is always placed at the root of the package, and must be
called \verb!package.json!. The fixed location allows for the package manager
to easily identify a package. The JSON format was chosen as it plain-text, and
easy to both read and write for both humans and machines.

In listing \ref{lst:simple_manifest} we show a simple package manifest. This
manifest showcases the most important features of the manifest. A complete
specification of the package manifest format can be seen in Appendix 1. The
service that this manifest describes is shown in figure \ref{fig:simple_calc}.

This manifest configures the ongoing example of the calculator system.
Lines 2-3 take care of the module definition. The remaining attributes,
however, are entirely unique to packages. Some attributes included in the
manifest are there for indexing and discoverability purposes, examples of such
attributes are shown in lines 4-6. The rest of the manifest describes the
dependencies of this package.
