# Stuff that needs to be written, which has not yet been written:

  - Primary package manager functions (Dependency trees, starting packages,
          general stuff)
  - Discussion of multiple registries (at TODO)
  - Discussion of dependencies (short)
  - Discussion of JPM backend (maybe as part of the introduction)
  - Integrity checks (Maybe mention code signing and make a reference, but
    don't talk about it)
  - Finish up authentication tokens 
  - Finish up on testing
  - Pull in sources

  - Explain shell notation
